# SPEED DETECTOR
# GOAL
Create a function that, depending on speed of car recorded, returns ok if spedd is less than 70km,
for every 5km above 70km, it deducts a poin(merit) from driver.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”
# Step 1
Create an empty repository
# Step 2
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input
# STEP 3
If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 
# STEP 4
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
# STEP 5
